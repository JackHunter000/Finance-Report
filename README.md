📊 Power BI Report: Finance-Report
📌 Project Description

This repository documents my Power BI report published in Power BI Service. The report is designed to visualize and analyze [brief description of dataset, e.g. “sales performance over time”, “customer behavior metrics”, “financial KPIs”].

The goal is to turn the raw data into an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore insights through visuals and filters.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI Desktop / Power BI Service — to create and publish the report

Data Source — (e.g. Excel, SQL database, API) that feeds the report

GitHub — to host documentation, version control, and share insights

📈 Key Features & Visuals

Here you explain what the report contains — replace example items below with your actual ones:

Trend Charts — show how key metrics evolve over time

Bar / Column Visuals — compare categories (e.g. regions, product lines)

Slicers / Filters — let the user interactively filter by time period, category, geography

KPI Cards / Summary Metrics — display high-level numbers (totals, averages, growth rates)

Drill-down / Hierarchies — allow navigating from high-level to detailed views

🧠 Insights & Findings

Share the most interesting insights or patterns discovered in the data. Some examples:

Metric X has been growing steadily over Q1–Q3

Region Y outperforms Region Z in average sales per customer

Seasonal dips or spikes revealed in the monthly trend

Correlations observed between metric A and metric B

🧮 Data & Report Structure

Describe how the report is built and how the data flows:

Data import & transformations (Power Query, M, DAX etc.)

Measures / calculations (e.g. growth %, running totals, comparisons)

Relationships between tables (if multiple tables used)

Any data modeling design decisions or performance optimizations
